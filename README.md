## 🎯 What Are DeFi Primitives?

**DeFi Primitives** are the fundamental building blocks of decentralized finance:

### The Core 8 Primitives

1. **Tokens (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155)** - Digital assets
2. **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)** - Token swaps
3. **Lending & Borrowing** - Money markets
4. **Stablecoins** - Price-stable assets
5. **Derivatives** - Options, futures, perpetuals
6. **Oracles** - Off-chain data feeds
7. **Governance** - Decentralized decision making
8. **Yield Aggregators** - Optimized returns

**Why Master Them?**
- Build any DeFi protocol from scratch
- Understand composability & money legos
- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Design novel financial products
- Become invaluable to Web3 teams
